## 🔴 Phase 2: Duplicate Detection & Intelligence (NOT STARTED)
### **Status:** Critical feature not yet implemented - embedding generation and duplicate detection logic completely missing

#### **Implement Embedding Generation** 
- [ ] Create `projects/utils.py` with embedding generation functions
- [ ] Integrate sentence-transformers for project embeddings (model: 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' - 384 dims, or use all-mpnet-base-v2 - 768 dims)
- [ ] Create functions:
  - [ ] `generate_embeddings(text)` - Generate embedding from text
  - [ ] `generate_project_embeddings(project)` - Generate all embeddings for a project
  - [ ] `batch_embed_all_projects()` - Batch embed existing projects
- [ ] Generate embeddings on project creation/update using Django signals
- [ ] Store embeddings in pgvector columns (title_embedding, objectives_embedding, combined_embedding - all 768 dimensions)
- [ ] Create management command `python manage.py generate_embeddings` for batch generation
- [ ] Verify pgvector extension is enabled in PostgreSQL (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`)

#### **Implement Duplicate Detection Algorithm**
- [ ] Create `projects/services.py` with similarity detection logic containing:
  - [ ] `calculate_cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)` - Compute similarity between two embeddings
  - [ ] `semantic_similarity_search(project, threshold=0.85)` - Find semantically similar projects using pgvector similarity search
  - [ ] `full_text_similarity(project, threshold=0.7)` - PostgreSQL full-text search on title/objectives (requires pg_trgm extension)
  - [ ] `hybrid_similarity_score(semantic_score, lexical_score, weights)` - Combine scores (default: 70% semantic, 30% lexical)
  - [ ] `check_project_for_duplicates(project_id)` - Find and flag duplicates for single project
  - [ ] `batch_duplicate_detection()` - Run duplicate detection on all projects
  - [ ] `flag_duplicates(project1_id, project2_id, similarity_score)` - Create DuplicateFlag records

#### **Duplicate Handling API Endpoints**
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/projects/{id}/duplicate_check/` - Manual trigger (PLACEHOLDER exists, needs implementation)
- [ ] Create `POST /api/projects/bulk_duplicate_check/` - Bulk duplicate detection
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/duplicate-flags/{id}/mark_reviewed/` - Mark as reviewed (SKELETON exists, needs full implementation)
- [ ] Wire up DuplicateFlag creation when similarity above threshold
- [ ] Add API response with detailed similarity breakdown (semantic + lexical scores)

#### **Configuration & Management**
- [ ] Add Django settings for similarity thresholds (SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.85, etc.)
- [ ] Create management command `python manage.py batch_detect_duplicates` 
- [ ] Add management command `python manage.py generate_embeddings --all`
- [ ] Add logging for duplicate detection operations
